## Usage

Each file is available as a separate artifact that you can copy and paste directly into your project. The files are designed to work together but can be adapted to your specific implementation needs.

Remember to:
1. Adapt import paths to match your project structure
2. Update database models according to your ORM
3. Integrate with your existing authentication system
4. Test thoroughly before deploying to production
